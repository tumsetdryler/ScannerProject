5.     Any other remarks.
	We found that it was easiest when we scheduled blocks of time to all get together and collaborate on the assignment together
	in real-time. As such, we eliminated the pressure one might feel from potentially struggling on their segment had they worked on it
	alone as well as eliminated any confusion that might be had when one goes to pull the latest code and it has changed quite a bit. The
	pair programming, or trio programming in this case, made debugging a breeze as well. Real-time voice chat and screen sharing furthered group
	chemistry as well.
